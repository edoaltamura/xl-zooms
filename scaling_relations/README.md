Scaling relations for zoom simulations
---
This directory includes scripts for generating different scaling relations, useful to
compare quantities calculated from zoom simulations with observational data. This is a 
Scott's list about the key scaling relations to check for diagnostics, along the lines 
of the C-EAGLE paper (Barnes+17).

- Hot gas mass (and fraction) vs halo mass
- Stellar mass (and fraction) vs halo mass
- BH mass vs halo mass (central BHs)
- BH mass (central) vs stellar mass (<50kpc)
- Hot gas mass-weighted temperature vs halo mass (with and without core, 0.15r500)
- Hot gas Fe metallicity vs halo mass or temperature (see also Francescaâ€™s paper on arXiv)
- Y_SZ vs halo mass - note we normally use Y_SZ within 5*r500
- X-ray luminosity vs halo mass (with and without core)
