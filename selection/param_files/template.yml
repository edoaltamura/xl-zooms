# This lists all the available options, not to be used as a param file in its native form.
# All params, e.g. the coordinates, are expected to be in the native units of the snapshot.
# NOTE: If you are using an automatic group selection, make sure you are using a Velociraptor
# output catalogue (.properties). SUBFIND output catalogues are deprecated as of 17-09-2020.
# If using automatic selection through the Velociraptor catalogue a sorting key must be selected
# and the GroupNumber is the index of the group in the list sorted by decreasing mass (from largest to
# smallest).
