# This lists all the avaliable options, not to be used as a param file.
# All params, eg the coordinates, are expected to be in the native units of the snapshot.

# Always required.
fname: The save name for the mask file.
snap_file: The location of the snapshot we are creating the mask from.
bits: The number of bits used in the particle IDs for the PH indexing. (EAGLE runs were 14).
shape: Shape of the region to reproduce, 'sphere', 'cubiod', 'slab'.
data_type: Can be 'gadget' or 'swift'.
divide_ids_by_two: True if you need to divide PIDs by two to get back to ICS (needed for eagle).

# For resimulating a single group.
GN: If you want to resimulate a halo (requires sub_file).
sub_file: The location of the subfind group catalogue (to find coordinates of given GN).
num_times_r200: How many times r200 of the passed group do you want to resim? Default is 1.0.

# For a region around a manual set of coordinates.
coords: Centre of region you want to resimulate (at the time of the passed snapsot). 
radius: If shape is sphere, need to provide the radius.
dim: If shape is a cubiod or slab, need to provide [x,y,z] array of the lengths.
