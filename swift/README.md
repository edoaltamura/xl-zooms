RUN_NAME
==========

Purpose of this file
------------
This file provides general information about the simulation run launched from this directory,
with configuration and output files saved in the ```pwd``` and its subdirectories.
This file is automatically generated after SWIFT and Velociraptor are compiled in place and
is by default configured with the basic run details, such as the *run name*, *DM_particle mass 
resolution* and the *simulation type (whether DM-only or hydro)*.
Further information may be added to this file during production or in the analysis phase.
This provides the end user of the simulation data with a guideline for the usage of the outputs
and the main features of this particular run.
**Note:** this file should not contain any information about the run production phase, which is
not present in parameter files, initial conditions or other configuration modules. This information
should always be backed up and kept consistent with its primary sources. The usefulness of this
file is to present the information in a more direct and user-friendly way.
